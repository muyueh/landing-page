# Landing Page Theme

This repository includes the Agnes landing page theme. GitHub Pages deployment is configured via GitHub Actions to publish the contents of the `agnes` folder.

## Local preview
Open `agnes/index.html` in a browser to preview the static site. All compiled assets are included in the `agnes/dist` directory.

## Deployment
Push changes to `main`, `master`, or `work` to trigger the **Deploy to GitHub Pages** workflow. The workflow uploads the `agnes` directory and deploys it to GitHub Pages. You can also run the workflow manually from the **Actions** tab.
